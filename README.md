# Popmenu notice
## This Fork requires major refactoring before it can be merged to tracerbench
Lighthouse metrics are represented by PhaseSample interface. 
Which isn't what PhaseSample name implies.
The forks waits for a hero to change all the namings and refactor the code and create a PR to the original tracerbench Repo;)
